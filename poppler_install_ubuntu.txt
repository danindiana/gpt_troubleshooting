The error message you've encountered indicates that the compilation of the python-poppler package is failing because the required C++ compiler is not found. The package needs to be compiled as part of the installation process, and it seems that the necessary C++ compiler is not installed on your system.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure you have a C++ compiler installed and configured on your Ubuntu Linux system. Here's how you can do that:

Install C++ Compiler:
Open a terminal and run the following command to install the GNU C++ compiler (g++):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++
This will install the GNU Compiler Collection, which includes the C++ compiler.

Retry the Installation:
Once you've installed the C++ compiler, try installing the python-poppler package again using pip. Make sure you are within your virtual environment (if you're using one):

bash
Copy code
source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate  # Activate your virtual environment
pip install python-poppler
If you continue to encounter issues, there might be additional dependencies or configuration requirements for the python-poppler package. You could also consider checking the package's official documentation or the GitHub repository for any installation troubleshooting steps.

If you're still facing problems, please provide any additional error messages or information, and I'll do my best to assist you further.

OK I install g++ and then re-ran: 'pip install python-poppler'

but got this error:

The error message indicates that the build process for the python-poppler package is failing due to a missing dependency called poppler-cpp. This is a C++ library that the package requires in order to compile and function properly.

To resolve this issue, you need to install the poppler-cpp library on your system before attempting to install the python-poppler package again. Here's how you can do it:

Install poppler-cpp:
Open a terminal and run the following command to install the poppler-cpp package:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpoppler-cpp-dev
This command will install the poppler-cpp development files, which include the necessary headers and libraries for building packages that depend on poppler-cpp.

Retry the Installation:
After installing the poppler-cpp library, try installing the python-poppler package again using pip. Make sure you are within your virtual environment (if you're using one):

bash
Copy code
source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate  # Activate your virtual environment
pip install python-poppler
This should resolve the missing dependency issue, and the installation process for the python-poppler package should now proceed without errors.

If you encounter any further issues or errors, please provide the additional information, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
